			<h1> Instructions </h1>

		<div class="main container">
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li> You are free to perform as many trials as you want, however given the large number of possible trials we urge you to <b>do atleast 50.</b>
				<li> A particular trial takes <b>less than 30 seconds</b> to complete.
				<li> In each trial, you will be shown two animal images along with a table of features on which to <b>judge the similarity</b> of those images.
				<li> For each feature, there is a <b>sliding bar</b> using which you will have to rate the similarity of that feature in two images on a <b>scale of 0-10</b> where <b>0</b> corresponsds to <b>"Very dissimilar"</b> or "Not similar at all" and <b>10</b> corresponds to <b>"Very similar".</b> 
				<li> <b>Important:</b> Your decision about similarity of features must be based <b>only on the visible content of the images shown to you and not on your general perception about the animals</b> in those images.
				<li> For cases when the decision about similarity of a feature cannot be made on the basis of the content visible in images, you must check the <b>"Can't judge"</b> checkbox provided beside the slidebar for that feature.
				<li> Apart from features, you are also required to <b>rate the overall similarity</b> of images shown to you on the same scale of 0-10 as described above.
				<li> <b> Feature description: </b> Here is a brief description about the features on which to rate similarity of images.
					<ul type="square">
						<li><b>Body shape:</b> It refers to the shape of the animal irrespective of its size and other features. For eg, a dog and a horse have a similar body shape, irrespective of the difference between sizes of their body.
						<li><b>Skin texture:</b> A judgement should be based on how much similar is the outer skin on two animals in aspects such as smoothness, luster, scales, etc.
						<li><b>Skin color:</b> Color of the outer skin of animals shown in images. Your decision should be based only on the particular animal shown in the image and not on your perception about the typical member of the species that animal belongs to.
						<li><b>Facial features:</b> These comprise all the features related to a face such as its shape, size, including also the nose, eyes, ears, mouth, whiskers, etc. Higher the number of matching facial features that you can identify in two images, higher should be your rating corresponding to 'Facial features'.
						<li><b>Limbs:</b> Various aspects of limbs such as number of them, size of them, what they are made up of, etc.  should be used to decide on the similarity between limbs of animals shown in two images. Again, as mentioned above, this decision should be based on what is visible in images. In case, you cannot see limbs, you must select the "Can't judge option".
						<li><b>Horns:</b> Most animals have horns and most do not. Out of those who have, these horns again differ in their shape and size and numbers. Rate the similarity on the basis of such characteristics. Also, for a comparison between both animals without horns, select the "Can't judge" option.
						<li><b>Mouth:</b> Rate the similarity on the basis of features of mouth such as its shape, color, size and other visible characteristics related to the mouth of animals in shown images. Note that this is not same as Facial features which constitutes all the features from a face including those of mouth. 
						<li><b>Overall similarity:</b> On the scale of 0-10, make a similarity judgement about the two images displayed to you taking into account all of the above features and other characteristics that you might find to be similar or dissimilar in those images.
					</ul>
				<li> After you have decided upon the similarity rating for each feature and overall similarity for two images, you may either choose to get a <b>new trial</b> by clicking on the <b>"Next"</b> button or finish the experiment by clicking on the <b>"Submit"</b> button.
					<ul type="square">
						<li> If you click on "Next", you will get a new combination of images and you will have to perform the similarity judgement in the same way as you did for the previous trial.
						<li> If you click on "Submit", you will be exited from the experiment. 
					</ul>
